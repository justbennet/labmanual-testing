We have written a manual that describes how to use GNU Make, a rather
old-fashioned development tool, for programming and executing
neuroimaging workflow. Originally we chose to use Make because it was
easy to learn, requiring minimal additional overhead once we decided
what the actual workflow should look like. However, this also made it
possible to use GNU Make as a way to get undergraduates (with few
programming skills) involved in conducting neuroimaging analyses. You
can read an overview of this approach in our Frontiers in
Neuroinformatics
[paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2016.00002/full).

A [case study describing the approach](https://www.practicereproducibleresearch.org/case-studies/tmadhyastha.html) is also available in a larger book describing examples of reproducible workflow.

There is a [video](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=video&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwjoqbGk9JTZAhVI_oMKHR3CBcsQtwIIKDAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrTfyctDUce0&usg=AOvVaw1JqGFRG2lVFqNvp30FionP) from Neurohackweek of Tara teaching some of this material. She is quite scared to watch it and so has not.

The data and examples to accompany the manual are available on
[NITRC](http://www.nitrc.org/projects/makepipelines/).
