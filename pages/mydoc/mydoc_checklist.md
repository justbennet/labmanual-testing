Any new research assistant in IBIC should complete the following steps.

- [ ] [Complete safety training to be around the DISC 3T Scanner.](http://depts.washington.edu/mrlab/SafetyTraining_Basics/certificationform.php)

This will involve a video component (for which you will probably want headphones) and an in-person safety training that will be scheduled after you complete the video component. You will need to use your UW email for this training to work.

Something about this interface is confusing, so make sure that you really submit your answers and have your in-person safety training shortly thereafter! This is necessary to be able to watch subjects being scanned.

- [ ] Get acquainted with the [3T/EEG calendar.](https://depts.washington.edu/mrlab/3T_mod/week.php)

    – If you will need to have scheduling access on an existing study, contact discsupp@uw.edu.

    – If you will be creating a new study, fill out a [PAF.](https://depts.washington.edu/mrlab/research/forms/DISC_PAF.pdf)

- If you will not be scheduling subjects, the main things to notice are how busy the scanner is and what types of studies are going on.

- [ ] Get an IBIC wiki account by contacting  kwoelfer@uw.edu.

- [ ] Get a NAS account by contacting kwoelfer@uw.edu.

- [ ] Get a XNAT account by registering at [https://xnatpro.ibic.washington.edu](https://xnatpro.ibic.washington.edu)

- [ ] Complete training to allow you to work with human subjects and their data:

   - HIPAA training. You need to register at [http://uwmedicinecompliance.uw.edu](http://uwmedicinecompliance.uw.edu). This takes an hour or two.

   - Human subjects training. Liza Young will help you get permissions to do this. This takes several hours.

- [ ] Learn the IBIC/DISC door codes and copy code.  Liza Young can provide these codes.

- [ ] Get added to mailing lists.  Liza can add you to the ibic-core mailing list and to any project-specific or interest group mailing lists that will be relevant. If you are working for Tara, ask to be put on all the lists. You can opt out later.

- [ ] Put IBIC lab meeting and any relevant interest group meetings on your calendar and attend if possible.
