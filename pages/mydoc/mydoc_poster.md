# Here are some tips for how to create a poster using power point:
## Step one, set your dimensions: How?

Go to Design -> page setup : then select the width and length you wish to use in your poster.

## Step two, create your background: How?

* Power point has a wonderful array of background themes to choose from: go to Design -> themes (choose one)
* You will probably want to insert a logo for your poster, whether it is the IBIC logo or some other picture you will save it as a picture and then go to: Insert -> picture . then you will choose it and paste it.
* If the theme you have chosen is *almost” right (the header space is too big/small/you want more space/color/pictures you can always click print screen (on your keyboard), open Microsoft paint, and make the changes you want, cut out the part you want to put back in your poster and then paste it back into power point. this is not necessary, but can make for some cool effects…
* Once you have reached the point where you are happy with the background for your poster, which may take a while, you will want to group all of the different elements of your background together (theme, logo, header, pictures etc) so that they become one “picture”. you might even want to save it so that you can easily use it the next time. How to group elements together? : Make sure all of the elements you wish to group together are selected, the way to select more than one element is to hold down the ctrl button while clicking on the elements, Go to: Home -> arrange -> group. to reverse this effect (say you wanted to make a change in your background later) you will do the same thing but instead of selecting “group” you select “ungroup”.
* Put the background IN the background: Another useful thing about arrange is that you can decide the order which your elements are displayed in. The closer your element is to the “front” the more likely it will be to show up. so an element in layer 1 would overshadow an element in layer 2. Since this is your background you will want it in the last (most back) layer. How? Go to Home -> arrange -> send to back.

## Step three, build your box: How?

* You will want (maybe, if not skip) to have boxes in which you will later put text, images and more. The right way to go about making boxes is to make the one you want, group all of its elements together, and then just copy paste it so you can adjust the size, location and content. How?
* Insert -> shape -> (choose your shape) , make your shape, decide about the color of the filling and the outline (which are both adjustable) . If you want you can put boxes inside boxes to create more sophisticated boxes with headers. you can even put your logo in the corner, you can do what ever you please but please only do it once, because there is no need to make yourself do more work than you need to.
* Once you are happy with your basic box you group it together: Home -> arrange -> group (all elements must be selected, click on all of them while holding down the ctrl button.
* Finally, click on the grouped finished box and copy it to wherever you please, it should be identical to your basic box, which makes for both consistent and pretty formatting and less work.

## Step four, layout your boxes and your result pictures: How?

* Once you have your boxes made, you will want to lay them out with your pictures so that you have a general idea of how your finished poster will look. This is a big time saver and good practice so that you don’t fixate on minutia and later realize that all your hard work went to waste because the layout doesnt work.
* Put in all your pictures and boxes (Insert -> picture/shape/header/footer/etc’
* Move them around until you are happy. How? Here are some tips to laying out your objects: if you want to make sure everything is aligned perfectly you can display smart guides when objects are aligned by going to: View -> show -> check box : display smart guides when objects are aligned.
* To have more control over the exact placement of the object and in particular if it keeps trying to align your element with something you don’t want it to you can go to View -> show -> uncheck box: snap objects…etc. If you are doing cosmetic surgery to an image in paint, this is particularly useful.
* If you are inserting a series of pictures, group them once you get them to be the same size, then you can adjust their size and location simultaneously. YAY.

## Step five, insert your text: How?

* First of all, at this point, everything should be already done. You should be happy with your layout and pictures and you should have put some thought into where your text will go. Try not to put too much text on your poster, a picture is worth a thousand words and a poster is all about visualization, it is eye candy, and your words will compliment it.
* Now you can insert text boxes into every space that you want to write things into. How? Go to Insert -> text box.
* After your text boxes are all inserted you should put thought into the font and in particular, the font SIZE you will be using. As this the poster is most probably larger than the computer screen (hopefully much larger) it can sometimes be tricky to tell what size fort is appropriate. You can always zoom in to see how it would look in “real” size. How? Go to View -> Zoom -> 100%. To “unzoom” click “fit to screen”. A general rule is that your main header should be around size 80 and your smallest text font should be around 30. give or take 10 or so. Your choice.

## Step six, print out a smaller version of your finished poster.

NO JOKE

## Final notes:

Your poster should be beautiful eye candy. You should be pleased with
it. It is a visual tool and there are zounds of possibilities in power
point so sometimes its hard not to overdo it with the effects. This is
a tricky line to find. On one hand you want to have a “WOW” poster, on
the other hand the most important thing about your poster must always
remain the information it conveys. The design should not overshadow
the information. It should compliment it. Muted colors work better and
uniformity goes a long way. Still you can add your own little element
that adds some…ooomf! (changing the background color on one of the
boxes, adding a logo somewhere unexpected etc. )

GOOD LUCK!
