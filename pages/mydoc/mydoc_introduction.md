## Overview 
This is the wiki site for the work-in-progress IBIC Lab
Manual. Please direct questions or concerns to Tara Madhyastha (madhyt
at uw.edu).

All new RAs should complete the items on the [Checklist
for New RAs](/mydoc_checklist.html) within the first few weeks of beginning. The [IBIC to
English Dictionary](/mydoc_dictionary.html) describes terms that may be new to you if you are
just starting to work with us.

## The UNIX Programming Environment

Linux is an operating system that is based upon UNIX. It is the most
popular platform for neuroimaging for a lot of good reasons, so you
will need to learn to manipulate neuroimaging files and develop
pipelines in this environment.

Some tutorials to get you started are available here:

* [Surrey UNIX tutorial](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/index.html)
* [Idaho State University Tutorial](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fslcourse/unix_intro/)
* Maya Reiter wrote a great [UNIX tutorial.](/mydoc_unixbible.html)

You can work through some sample questions on various topics in [Sample UNIX Questions.](/mydoc_sampleunixquestions.html)

Once you feel comfortable with shell scripting, you can move on to
learning GNU Make for writing neuroimaging workflows.

## Higher Level Scripting

Once you have mastered shell scripting and make, or maybe before, you
will reach the point where you want to do something that is really
difficult to do in bash. Perhaps you want to dig into an image and run
some cool machine learning algorithm on it. Or maybe you just want to
generate your demographic table for your subjects automatically.

You need to learn a more general-purpose scripting language. There are
three good choices for neuroimaging: MATLAB, Python and R.

Some resources for learning R: 
* [R code School](http://tryr.codeschool.com)
* Great [blog entry on writing an R package from scratch](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/)

Here are some [[higherlevelproblems:example problems]] that you can try to solve using your favorite scripting language.
