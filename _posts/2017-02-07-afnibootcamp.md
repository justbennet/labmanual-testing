IBIC is hosting an AFNI Bootcamp at UW in Seattle! Bob Cox and the AFNI team will be here
on July 9-13, 2018 to answer all of your AFNI-related questions. Registration is $100 for non-IBIC members and will be used towards a good workshop-related cause (salmon? refreshments? sunsets over olympics?). [Check out the web site to register and get the most recent updates on how you can get ready.](https://ibic.github.io/afnibootcamp/)

If you don't believe me - believe Andy - he describes the experience from 2012 well ("the nerd bachchanalia continued to rage underneath the carmine streaks of the western sun") in his epic [blog.](http://andysbrainblog.blogspot.com/2012/12/afni-bootcamp-feburary-25th-march-1st.html) Things have only gotten better.
